{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-intro","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## What Is Data Science?\n\nData science is a multifaceted field, often conceptualized as resting\non three fundamental pillars: mathematics/statistics, computer\nscience, and domain-specific knowledge. This framework helps to\nunderscore the interdisciplinary nature of data science, where\nexpertise in one area is often complemented by foundational knowledge\nin the others.\n\n\nA compelling definition was offered by Prof. Bin Yu in her 2014\nPresidential Address to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.\nShe defines\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mbox{Data Science} =\n\\mbox{S}\\mbox{D}\\mbox{C}^3,\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere\n\n+ 'S' represents Statistics, signifying the crucial role of\nstatistical methods in understanding and interpreting data;\n+ 'D' stands for domain or science knowledge, indicating the\nimportance of specialized expertise in a particular field of study;\n+ the three 'C's denotes computing, collaboration/teamwork, and\ncommunication to outsiders.\n\nComputing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and\nalgorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently\ncollaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams\nwith diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the\nimportance of translating complex data insights into understandable\nand actionable information for non-experts.\n\n\nThis definition neatly captures the essence of data science,\nemphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the\nability to communicate effectively.\n\n\n## Expectations from This Course\n\nIn this course, students will be expected to achieve the following outcomes:\n\n- **Proficiency in Project Management with Git**: Develop a solid\n    understanding of Git for efficient and effective project\n    management. This involves mastering version control, branching,\n    and collaboration through this powerful tool.\n\n\n- **Proficiency in Project Reporting with Quarto**: Gain expertise in\n    using Quarto for professional-grade project reporting. This\n    encompasses creating comprehensive and visually appealing reports\n    that effectively communicate your findings.\n    \n\n- **Hands-On Experience with Real-World Data Science Projects**:\n    Engage in practical data science projects that reflect real-world\n    scenarios. This hands-on approach is designed to provide you with\n    direct experience in tackling actual data science challenges.\n    \n\n- **Competency in Using Python and Its Extensions for Data Science**:\n    Build strong skills in Python, focusing on its extensions relevant\n    to data science. This includes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and\n    Matplotlib, among others, which are critical for data analysis and\n    visualization.\n    \n\n- **Full Grasp of the Meaning of Results from Data Science Algorithms**:\n    Learn to not only apply data science algorithms but\n    also to deeply understand the implications and meanings of their\n    results. This is crucial for making informed decisions based on\n    these outcomes.\n    \n\n- **Basic Understanding of the Principles of Data Science Methods**:\n    Acquire a foundational knowledge of the underlying principles of\n    various data science methods. This understanding is key to\n    effectively applying these methods in practice.\n    \n\n- **Commitment to the Ethics of Data Science**: Emphasize the\n    importance of ethical considerations in data science. This\n    includes understanding data privacy, bias in data and algorithms,\n    and the broader social implications of data science work.\n    \n\n## Computing Environment\n\nAll setups are operating system dependent. As soon as possible, stay away from\nWindows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nOn Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.\n\nOn Windows, several options can be considered.\n\n+ Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL): <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>\n+ Cygwin (with X): <https://x.cygwin.com>\n+ Git Bash: <https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash>\n\nTo jump start, here is a tutorial:\n[Ubunto Linux for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).\n\nAt least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across\ndirectories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.\n\nHere are several commonly used shell commands:\n\n+ `cd`: change directory; `..` means parent directory.\n+ `pwd`: present working directory.\n+ `ls`: list the content of a folder; `-l` long version;\n   `-a` show hidden files; `-t` ordered by modification time.\n+ `mkdir`: create a new directory.\n+ `cp`: copy file/folder from a source to a target.\n+ `mv`: move file/folder from a source to a target.\n+ `rm`: remove a file a folder.\n\n\n### Python\n\nSet up Python on your computer:\n\n- Python 3.\n- Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.\n- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)\n\nI will be using VS Code in class.\n\nReadability is important!\nCheck your Python coding styles against the recommended styles:\n<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>. A good place to start is the Section on\n\"Code Lay-out\". \n\n\nOnline books on Python for data science:\n\n+  [“Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data,” First Edition](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), by Jake VanderPlas, O’Reilly Media, 2016. \n2. [“Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython.” Third Edition](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), by Wes McK- inney, O’Reilly Media, 2022. \n\n\n<!-- This section is to be
