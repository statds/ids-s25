Each operating system\nhas its own package management system. For example:\n\n\n- **Linux:** Linux distributions have a variety of package managers\n    depending on the distribution. For instance, Ubuntu uses APT\n    (Advanced Package Tool), Fedora uses DNF (Dandified Yum), and Arch\n    Linux uses Pacman. These package managers are integral to the\n    Linux experience, allowing users to install, update, and manage\n    software packages easily from repositories.\n\n\n- **macOS:** macOS uses Homebrew as its primary package\n    manager. Homebrew simplifies the installation of software and\n    tools that aren't included in the standard macOS installation,\n    using simple commands in the terminal.\n\n\n- **Windows:** Windows users often rely on the Microsoft Store for\n    apps and software. For more developer-focused package management,\n    tools like Chocolatey and Windows Package Manager (Winget) are\n    used. Additionally, recent versions of Windows have introduced the\n    Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows Windows users to run\n    a Linux environment directly on Windows, unifying Windows and\n    Linux applications and tools. This is particularly useful for\n    developers and data scientists who need to run Linux-specific\n    software or scripts. It saves a lot of trouble Windows users used\n    to have before its time.\n\nUnderstanding the package management system of your operating system\nis crucial for effectively managing and installing software,\nespecially for data science tools and applications.\n\n### File System\n\nA file system is a fundamental aspect of a computer's operating\nsystem, responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved on a\nstorage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash\ndrive. Essentially, it provides a way for the OS and users to organize\nand keep track of files. Different operating systems typically use\ndifferent file systems. For instance, NTFS and FAT32 are common in\nWindows, APFS and HFS+ in macOS, and Ext4 in many Linux\ndistributions. Each file system has its own set of rules for\ncontrolling the allocation of space on the drive and the naming,\nstorage, and access of files, which impacts performance, security, and\ncompatibility. Understanding file systems is crucial for tasks such as\ndata recovery, disk partitioning, and managing file permissions,\nmaking it an important concept for anyone working with computers,\nespecially in data science and IT fields.\n\n\nNavigating through folders in the command line, especially in\nUnix-like environments such as Linux or macOS, and Windows Subsystem\nfor Linux (WSL), is an essential skill for effective file\nmanagement. The command cd (change directory) is central to this\nprocess. To move into a specific directory, you use `cd` followed by the\ndirectory name, like `cd Documents`. To go up one level in the directory\nhierarchy, you use `cd ..`. To return to the home directory, simply\ntyping `cd` or `cd ~` will suffice. The `ls` command lists all files and\nfolders in the current directory, providing a clear view of your\noptions for navigation. Mastering these commands, along with others\nlike `pwd` (print working directory), which displays your current\ndirectory, equips you with the basics of moving around the file system\nin the command line, an indispensable skill for a wide range of\ncomputing tasks in Unix-like systems.\n\n\nYou have programmed in Python. Regardless of your skill level, let us\ndo some refreshing.\n\n## The Python World\n\n+ Function: a block of organized, reusable code to complete certain\n  task.\n+ Module: a file containing a collection of functions, variables, and\n  statements.\n+ Package: a structured directory containing collections of modules\n  and an `__init.py__` file by which the directory is interpreted as a\n  package.\n+ Library: a collection of related functionality of codes. It is a\n  reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it in our\n  program, we can just use it by importing that library and calling\n  the method of that library with period(.).\n\nSee, for example, [how to build a Python\nlibratry](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-python-library-7d5aea80cc3f).\n\n\n## Standard Library\n\nPython’s has an extensive standard library that offers a wide range of\nfacilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. \nSee documentation [online](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).\n\n> The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to\n> system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to\n> Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide\n> standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday\n> programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and\n> enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away\n> platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the constant $e$ to an arbitary precision?\n\nThe constant is only represented by a given double precision.\n```{python}\nimport math\nprint(\"%0.20f\" % math.e)\nprint(\"%0.80f\" % math.e)\n```\nNow use package `decimal` to export with an arbitary precision.\n```{python}\nimport decimal  # for what?\n\n## set the required number digits to 150\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 150\ndecimal.Decimal(1).exp().to_eng_string()\ndecimal.Decimal(1).exp().to_eng_string()[2:]\n```\n\n## Important Libraries\n\n+ NumPy\n+ pandas\n+ matplotlib\n+ IPython/Jupyter\n+ SciPy\n+ scikit-learn\n+ statsmodels\n\nQuestion: how to draw a random sample from a normal distribution and\nevaluate the density and distributions at these points?\n```{python}\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\nmu, sigma = 2, 4\nmean, var, skew, kurt = norm.stats(mu, sigma, moments='mvsk')\nprint(mean, var, skew, kurt)\nx = norm.rvs(loc = mu, scale = sigma, size = 10)\nx\n```\nThe pdf and cdf can be evaluated:\n```{python}\nnorm.pdf(x, loc = mu, scale = sigma)\n```\n\n\n## Writing a Function\n\nConsider the Fibonacci Sequence\n$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...$.\nThe next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.\nWe are going to use 3 ways to solve the problems.\n\n\nThe first is a recursive solution.\n```{python}\ndef fib_rs(n):\n    if (n==1 or n==2):\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib_rs(n - 1) + fib_rs(n - 2)\n\n%timeit fib_rs(10)\n```\n\nThe second uses dynamic programming memoization.\n```{python}\ndef fib_dm_helper(n, mem):\n    if mem[n] is not None:\n        return mem[n]\n    elif (n == 1 or n == 2):\n        result = 1\n    else:\n        result = fib_dm_helper(n - 1, mem) + fib_dm_helper(n - 2, mem)\n    mem[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef fib_dm(n):\n    mem = [None] * (n + 1)\n    return fib_dm_helper(n, mem)\n\n%timeit fib_dm(10)\n```\n\nThe third is still dynamic programming but bottom-up.\n```{python}\ndef fib_dbu(n):\n    mem = [None] * (n + 1)\n    mem[1] = 1;\n    mem[2] = 1;\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        mem[i] = mem[i - 1] + mem[i - 2]\n    return mem[n]\n\n\n%timeit fib_dbu(500)\n```\n\nApparently, the three solutions have very different performance for\nlarger `n`.\n\n\n### Monty Hall\nHere is a function that performs the Monty Hall experiments.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef montyhall(ndoors, ntrials):\n    doors = np.arange(1, ndoors + 1) / 10\n    prize = np.random.choice(doors, size=ntrials)\n    player = np.random.choice(doors, size=ntrials)\n    host = np.array([np.random.choice([d for d in doors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   if d not in [player[x], prize[x]]])\n\t\t\t\t\t for x in range(ntrials)])\n    player2 = np.array([np.random.choice([d for d in doors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  if d not in [player[x], host[x]]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor x in range(ntrials)])\n    return {'noswitch': np.sum(prize == player), 'switch': np.sum(prize == player2)}\n```\n\nTest it out:\n```{python}\nmontyhall(3, 1000)\nmontyhall(4, 1000)\n```\n\nThe true value for the two strategies with $n$ doors are, respectively,\n$1 / n$ and $\\frac{n - 1}{n (n - 2)}$.\n\n\n## Variables versus Objects\n\nIn Python, variables and the objects they point to actually live in\ntwo different places in the computer memory. Think of variables as\npointers to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being\nthose objects. This matters when multiple variables point to the same\nobject.\n```{python}\nx = [1, 2, 3]  # create a list; x points to the list\ny = x          # y also points to the same list in the memory\ny.append(4)    # append to y\nx              # x changed!\n```\nNow check their addresses\n```{python}\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n```\n\n\nNonetheless, some data types in Python are \"immutable\", meaning that\ntheir values cannot be changed in place. One such example is strings.\n```{python}\nx = \"abc\"\ny = x\ny = \"xyz\"\nx\n```\n\nNow check their addresses\n```{python}\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n```\n\nQuestion: What's mutable and what's immutable?\n\nAnything that is a collection of other objects is mutable, except\n``tuples``.\n\nNot all manipulations of mutable objects change the object rather than\ncreate a new object. Sometimes when you do something to a mutable\nobject, you get back a new object. Manipulations that change an\nexisting object, rather than create a new one, are referred to as\n“in-place mutations” or just “mutations.” So:\n\n+ __All__ manipulations of immutable types create new objects.\n+ __Some__ manipulations of mutable types create new objects.\n\nDifferent variables may all be pointing at the same object is\npreserved through function calls (a behavior known as “pass by\nobject-reference”). So if you pass a list to a function, and that\nfunction manipulates that list using an in-place mutation, that change\nwill affect any variable that was pointing to that same object outside\nthe function.\n```{python}\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = x\n\ndef append_42(input_list):\n    input_list.append(42)\n    return input_list\n\nappend_42(x)\n```\nNote that both `x` and `y` have been appended by $42$.\n\n## Number Representation\n\nNumers in a computer's memory are represented by binary styles (on and\noff of bits).\n\n### Integers\nIf not careful, It is easy to be bitten by overflow with integers when\nusing Numpy and Pandas in Python.\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array(2 ** 63 - 1 , dtype = 'int')\nx\n# This should be the largest number numpy can display, with\n# the default int8 type (64 bits)\n```\n\n*Note: on Windows and other platforms, `dtype = 'int'` may have to be changed to `dtype = np.int64` for the code to execute. Source: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38314118/overflowerror-python-int-too-large-to-convert-to-c-long-on-windows-but-not-ma)*\n\nWhat if we increment it by 1?\n```{python}\ny = np.array(x + 1, dtype = 'int')\ny\n# Because of the overflow, it becomes negative!\n```\nFor vanilla Python, the overflow errors are checked and more digits\nare allocated when needed, at the cost of being slow.\n```{python}\n2 ** 63 * 1000\n```\nThis number is 1000 times larger than the prior number,\nbut still displayed perfectly without any overflows\n\n### Floating Number\n\nStandard double-precision floating point number uses 64 bits. Among\nthem, 1 is for sign, 11 is for exponent, and 52 are fraction significand,\nSee <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format>.\nThe bottom line is that, of course, not every real number is exactly\nrepresentable.\n\nIf you have played the Game 24, here is a tricky one:\n```{python}\n8 / (3 - 8 / 3) == 24\n```\nSurprise?\n\nThere are more.\n```{python}\n0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3\n```\n\n```{python}\n0.3 - 0.2 == 0.1\n```\n\nWhat is really going on?\n```{python}\nimport decimal\ndecimal.Decimal(0.1)\n```\n\n```{python}\ndecimal.Decimal(8 / (3 - 8 / 3))\n```\n\nBecause the mantissa bits are limited, it can not represent a floating point\nthat's both very big and very precise. Most computers can represent all integers\nup to $2^{53}$, after that it starts skipping numbers.\n\n```{python}\n2.1 ** 53 + 1 == 2.1 ** 53\n\n# Find a number larger than 2 to the 53rd\n```\n\n```{python}\nx = 2.1 ** 53\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    x = x + 1\nx == 2.1 ** 53\n```\nWe add 1 to `x` by 1000000 times, but it still equal to its initial\nvalue,  `2.1 ** 53`. This is because this number is too big that computer\ncan't handle it with precision like add 1.\n\nMachine epsilon is the smallest positive floating-point number `x` such that\n`1 + x != 1`.\n```{python}\nprint(np.finfo(float).eps)\nprint(np.finfo(np.float32).eps)\n```\n\n\n## Virtual Environment {#sec-python-venv}\nVirtual environments in Python are essential tools for managing\ndependencies and ensuring consistency across projects. They allow\nyou to create isolated environments for each project, with its\nown set of installed packages, separate from the global Python\ninstallation. This isolation prevents conflicts between project\ndependencies and versions, making your projects more reliable\nand easier to manage. It's particularly useful when working on\nmultiple projects with differing requirements, or when\ncollaborating with others who may have different setups.\n\n\nTo set up a virtual environment, you first need to ensure that \nPython is installed on your system. Most modern Python \ninstallations come with the venv module, which is used to create \nvirtual environments. Here's how to set one up:\n\n+ Open your command line interface.\n+ Navigate to your project directory.\n+ Run `python3 -m venv myenv`, where `myenv` is the name of the\nvirtual environment to be created. Choose an informative name.\n\nThis command creates a new directory named `myenv` (or your chosen \nname) in your project directory, containing the virtual \nenvironment.\n\n\nTo start using this environment, you need to activate it. The \nactivation command varies depending on your operating system:\n\n+ On Windows, run `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`.\n+ On Linux or MacOS, use `source myenv/bin/activate` or\n  `. myenv/bin/activate`.\n\nOnce activated, your command line will typically show the name of \nthe virtual environment, and you can then install and use packages \nwithin this isolated environment without affecting your global \nPython setup.\n\n\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` in your \ncommand line. This will return you to your system’s global Python \nenvironment.\n\n\nAs an example, let's install a package, like `numpy`, in this\nnewly created virtual environment:\n\n+ Ensure your virtual environment is activated.\n+ Run `pip install numpy`.\n\nThis command installs the requests library in your virtual \nenvironment. You can verify the installation by running\n`pip list`, which should show requests along with its version.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"python.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
