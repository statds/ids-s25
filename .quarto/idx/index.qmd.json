This cooperative approach to education was\nfacilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages\ncollaborative coding and content development. To view\nthese contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please\nvisit our GitHub repository at <https://github.com/statds/ids-s25>.\n\n\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests\nto our GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the\ncourse material but also provided students with practical experience\nin collaborative software development and version control. \n\n\nFor those interested, class notes from\n[Fall 2024](https://statds.github.io/ids-f24),\n[Spring 2024](https://statds.github.io/ids-s24),\n[Spring 2023](https://statds.github.io/ids-s23), and\n[Spring 2022](https://statds.github.io/ids-s22/)\nare also publicly accessible. These archives offer\ninsights into the evolution of the course content and the\ndifferent perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.\n\n\n## Compiling the Classnotes\nTo reproduce the classnotes output on your own computer, here are the\nnecessary steps:\n\n+ Clone the classnotes repository to an appropriate location on your\n  computer; see Chapter @sec-git for using Git.\n+ Set up a Python virtual environment in the root folder of the\n  source; see Section @sec-python-venv.\n+ Activate your virtual environment.\n+ Install all the packages specified in `requirements.txt` in your\n  virtual environment:\n ```\n pip install -r requirements.txt\n ```\n+ For some chapters that need to interact with Google map services,\n  you need to save your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in the\n  root folder of the source.\n+ Render the book with `quarto render` from the root folder on a\n  terminal; the rendered book will be stored under `_book`.\n\n\n## Midterm Project\n\nReproduce NYC street flood research [@agonafir2022machine;\n@agonafir2022understanding].\n\n\nFour students will be selected to present their work in a workshop at\nthe [2025 NYC Open Data Week](https://2025.open-data.nyc). You are\nwelcome to invite your family and friends to join the the workshop.\n\n\n## Final Project\n\nStudents are encouraged to start designing their final projects from\nthe beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be\nused. Here is a list of data challenges that you may find useful:\n\n+ [ASA Data Challenge\n  Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home): big data in 2025\n+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)\n+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)\n+ [15 Data Science Hackathons to Test Your Skills in 2025](https://www.fynd.academy/blog/data-science-hackathons}\n\nIf you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a\nposter to [Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium\n(CSAS) 2025](https://statds.org/events/csas2025/).\n\n\n## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\n\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a\ncritical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this\ninsightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:\n\n> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,\n> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of\n> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown\n> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online\n> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a\n> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found\n> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is\n> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible\n> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you\n> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our\nstudents: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast\nresources available to solve complex problems in data science.\nExamples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware);\nsearch and find solutions to encountered problems. \n\n## Wishlist\n\nThis is a wish list from all members of the class (alphabetical\norder, last name first, comma, then first name). Here is an example.\n\n\n+ Yan, Jun\n    - Make practical data science tools accessible to undergraduates.\n    - Pass real-world data science project experience to students.\n    - Co-develop a Quarto book in collaboration with the students.\n    - Train students to participate real data science competitions.\n\n\nAdd yours through a pull request; note the syntax of nested list in\nMarkdown. \n\n\n### Students in 3255\n+ Ackerman, John\n+ Alsadadi, Ammar Shaker\n+ Chen, Yifei\n+ El Zein, Amer Hani\n+ Febles, Xavier Milan\n+ Horn, Alyssa Noelle\n+ Hutchins, Isabella Grace\n+ Jun, Joann\n+ Kline, Daniel Esteban\n+ Lagutin, Vladislav\n+ Lang, Lang\n+ Li, Shiyi\n+ Lin, Selena\n+ Long, Ethan Kenneth\n+ Nasejje, Ruth Nicole\n+ Pfeifer, Nicholas Theodore\n    - Learn about data science techniques in python\n    - Learn and thoroughly practice using git and github\n\n+ Reed, Kyle Daniel\n+ Roy, Luke William\n+ Schittina, Thomas\n+ Schlessel, Jacob E\n+ Symula, Sebastian\n+ Tamhane, Shubhan\n+ Tomaino, Mario Anthony\n\n### Students in 5255\n+ Edo, Mezmur Wossenu\n+ Mundiwala, Mohammad Moiz \n+ Vellore, Ajeeth Krishna\n+ Zhang, Gaofei\n\n\n\n## Course Logistics\n### Presentation Orders\n\nThe topic presentation order is set up in class.\n```{python}\n#| eval: true\n\nwith open('rosters/3255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    ug = [line.strip() for line in file]\nwith open('rosters/5255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    gr = [line.strip() for line in file]\npresenters = ug + gr\ntarget = \"Blanchard\"  # pre-arranged 1st presenter\npresenters = [name for name in presenters if target not in name]\n\nimport random\n## seed jointly set by the class\nrandom.seed(5347 + 2896 + 9050 + 1687 + 63)\nrandom.sample(presenters, len(presenters))\n## random.shuffle(presenters) # This would shuffle the list in place\n```\n\nSwitching slots is allowed as long as you find someone who\nis willing to switch with you. In this case, make a pull request\nto switch the order and let me know.\n\n\nYou are welcome to choose a topic that you are interested the \nmost, subject to some order restrictions. For example, decision\ntree should be presented before random forest or extreme gradient\nboosting. This justifies certain requests for switching slots.\n\n\n\n### Presentation Task Board\n\nHere are some example tasks:\n\n+ Making presentations with Quarto\n+ Markdown jumpstart\n+ Data science communication skills\n+ Import/Export data\n+ Arrow as a cross-platform data format\n+ Database operation with Structured query language (SQL)\n+ Grammer of graphics\n+ Handling spatial data\n+ Visualize spatial data in a Google map\n+ Animation\n+ Classification and regression trees\n+ Support vector machine\n+ Random forest\n+ Naive Bayes\n+ Bagging vs boosting\n+ Neural networks\n+ Deep learning\n+ TensorFlow\n+ Autoencoders\n+ Reinforcement learning\n+ Developing a Python package\n+ Web scraping\n\n\nPlease use the following table to sign up.\n\n   Date  | Presenter              | Topic\n  ------ | ---------------------- | ------\n   09/11 | Zachary Blanchard    | Presentation with Quarto\n   09/16 | Deyu Xu                | Import/Export data\n   09/18 | Sara Clokey            | Communications in Data Science\n   09/23 | Dorathea Johnson       | Database with SQL\n   09/25 | Xavier Febles           | Statistical tests\n   09/30 | Jack Bienvenue         | Visualizing Spatial Data in a Google Map\n   10/02 | Julia Mazzola          | Data VisualiZation with Plotnine\n   10/07 | Suha Akach             | Naive Bayes classifier\n   10/09 | Rahul Manna            | Animation\n   10/23 | Jaden Astle            | Classification and Regression Trees \n   10/23 | Olivia Kashalapov      | Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)\n   10/28 | Data science alumni panel |\n   10/30 | Emily Borowski         | Random Forest\n   10/30 | Aditya Paricharak      | Neural Networks\n   11/04 | Melanie Desroches      | Web Scraping\n   11/06 | Qianruo Tan            | Reinforcement Learning\n   11/11 | Aansh Jha              | K-means Clustering\n   11/11 | Owen Babiec            | Calling R from Python and Vice Versa\n   11/13 | Stef Baptista            |\n   11/13 | Mohammad Parvez   | Extracting and Analyzing Census Data\n\n\n### Final Project Presentation Schedule\n\nWe use the same order as the topic presentation for undergraduate\nfinal presentation. An [introduction on how to use Quarto to prepare\npresentation slides](https://github.com/statds/ids-f24/blob/main/templates/presentation.qmd)\nis availabe under the `templates` directory in\nthe classnotes source tree, thank to Zachary Blanchard, which can\nbe used as a template to start with.\n\n   Date  | Presenter\n  ------ | ---------------------- \n   11/18 | Sara Clokey; Dorothea Johnson; Xavier Febles; Jack Bienvenue\n   11/20 | Julia Mazzola; Suha Akach; Rahul Manna; Jaden Astle\n   12/02 | Olivia Kashalapov; Emily Borowskiï¼›Qianruo Tan; Melanie Desroches\n   12/04 | Aditya Paricharak; Aansh Jha; Owen Babiec; Stef Baptista\n\n\n### Contributing to the Class Notes\n\nContribution to the class notes is through a `pull request'.\n\n+ Start a new branch and switch to the new branch.\n+ On the new branch, add a `qmd` file for your presentation\n+ If using Python, create and activate a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` \n+ Edit `_quarto.yml` add a line for your `qmd` file to include it in the notes.\n+ Work on your qmd file, test with `quarto render`.\n+ When satisfied, commit and make a pull request with your quarto files and an updated `requirements.txt`.\n\nI have added a template file `mysection.qmd` and a new line to `_quarto.yml`\nas an example.\n\nFor more detailed style guidance, please see my notes on [statistical\nwriting](https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/using-the-right-tools-for-writing.html#latex-for-typesetting).\n\n\nPlagiarism is to be prevented. Remember that these class notes are publicly\navailable online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on [how to\navoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). \nIn particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use\nour own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the\ncode chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.\n\n\n### Homework Logistics\n\n\n#### Workflow of Submitting Homework Assisngment\n\n+ Click the GitHub classroom assignment link in HuskCT announcement.\n+ Accept the assignment and follow the instructions to an empty\n  repository.\n+ Make a clone of the repo at an appropriate folder on your own\n  computer with `git clone`.\n+ Go to this folder, add your qmd source, work on it, and group your\n  changes to different commits.\n+ Push your work to your GitHub repo with `git push`.\n+ Create a new release and put the generated pdf file in it for ease\n  of grading.\n\n\n#### Requirements\n+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See Chapter @sec-git.\n    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).\n        - Never \"Upload\" your files; use the git command lines.\n        - Make commit message informative (think about the readers).\n    - Make at least 10 commits and form a style of frequent small commits.\n+ Track `quarto` sources only in your repo. See Chapter @sec-quarto.\n+ For the convenience of grading, add your standalone html or pdf\n  output to a release in your repo.\n+ For standalone pdf output, you will need to have\n  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed.\n\n### Quizzes about Syllabus\n\n+ Do I accept late homework?\n+ Could you list a few examples of email etiquette?\n+ How would you lose style points?\n+ Would you use CLI and GUI?\n+ How many students will present at 2025 NYC ODW and when will the\n  presentations be?\n+ What's the first date on which you have to complete something about\n  your final project?\n+ Can you use AI for any task in this course? \n+ Anybody needs a reference letter? How could you help me to help you?\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Data analysis\n\n+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively\n+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing\n+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later\n+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators\n\n### Presentation\n\n+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator.\n+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code.\n+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize.\n+ Use your own examples to reduce the risk of plagiarism.\n\n\n<!-- Topic presentation template -->\n{{< include templates/_mysection.qmd
