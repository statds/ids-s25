# Exercises {#sec-ex}

1. **Quarto and Git setup**
  Quarto and Git are two important tools for data science. Get
  familiar with them through the following tasks. Please use
  the [`templates/hw.qmd`](https://github.com/statds/ids-f24/blob/main/templates/hw.qmd)
  template to document, for each step, what you did, the obstacles you
  encountered, and how you overcame them. Think of this as a user
  manual for students who are new to this. Use the command line
  interface.
    a.  Set up SSH authentication between your computer and your
	GitHub account.
    a.  Install Quarto onto your computer following the instructions
    of [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 
    a.  Pick a tool of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook,
    Emacs, etc.), follow the instructions to reproduce the example
    of line plot on polar axis.
    a.  Render the homework into a pdf file and put the file into
    a release in your GitHub repo.
    
1. **Working on Homework Problems**
  All the requirements on homework styles have reasons. Reviewing
  these questions help you to understand them.
    a.  What are the differences between binary and source files?
    a.  Why do we not want to track binary files in a repo?
    a.  Why do I require pdf output via release?
    a.  Why do I not want your files added via 'upload'?
    a.  Why do I require line width under 80?
    a.  Why is it not a good idea to have spaces in file/folder names?

1. **Contributing to the Class Notes**
  To contribute to the classnotes, you need to have a working
  copy of the sources on your computer. Document the following
  steps in a `qmd` file in the form of a step-by-step manual, as if
  you are explaining them to someone who wants to contribute too. Make
  at least 10 commits for this task, each with an informative message.
    a.  Create a fork of the notes repo into your own GitHub account.
    a.  Clone it to an appropriate folder on your computer.
    a.  Render the classnotes on your computer; document the obstacles
    and solutions.
    a.  Make a new branch (and name it appropriately) to experiment
    with your changes.
    a.  Checkout your branch and add your wishes to the wish list; 
    commit with an informative message; and
    push the changes to your GitHub account.
    a.  Make a pull request to class notes repo from your fork at
    GitHub. Make sure you have clear messages to document the changes.

1. **Monty Hall**
   Consider a generalized Monty Hall experiment. Suppose that the game
   start with $n$ doors; after you pick one, the host opens
   $m \le n - 2$ doors, that show no award.  Include sufficient text
   around the code chunks to explain them.
    a.  Write a function to simulate the experiment once. The function
   takes two arguments `ndoors` and `nempty`, which represent the
   number of doors and the number of empty doors showed by the host,
   respectively, It returns the result of two strategies, switch and
   no-switch, from playing this game. 
    a.  Play this game with 3 doors and 1 empty a few times.
	a.  Play this game with 10 doors and 8 empty a few times.
    a.  Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through
   simulation. The function takes three arguments `ndoors`, `nempty`,
   and  `ntrials`, where `ntrial` is
   the number of trials in a simulation. The function
   should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and
   no-switch strategy. 
    a.  Apply your function with 3 doors (1 empty) and 10 doors (8 empty),
   both with 1000 trials. Summarize your results.

1.  **Approximating $\pi$**
   Write a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of $\pi$. The
   function takes a Monte Carlo sample size `n` as input, and returns
   a point estimate of $\pi$ and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your
   function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000. Repeat the experiment 
   1000 times for each sample size and check the empirical probability that the
   confidence intervals cover the true value of $\pi$. Comment on
   the results.

1.  **Google Billboard Ad**
   Find the first 10-digit prime number occurring in consecutive
   digits of $e$. This was a [Google recruiting
   ad](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/news/2004-10-13/google/).

1. **Game 24**
   The [math game 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game) is one of the
   addictive games among number lovers. With four randomly selected cards from
   a deck of poker cards, use all four values and elementary arithmetic
   operations ($+-\times /$) to come up with 24. Let $\square$ be one of
   the four numbers. Let $\bigcirc$ represent one of the four operators.
   For example, 
   \begin{equation*}
    (\square \bigcirc \square) \bigcirc (\square \bigcirc \square)
   \end{equation*}
   is one way to group the the operations.
   a.  List all the possible ways to group the four numbers.
   a.  How many possible ways are there to check for a solution?
   a.  Write a function to solve the problem in a brutal force way. The
   inputs of the function are four numbers. The function returns a list
   of solutions. Some of the solutions will be equivalent, but let us
   not worry about that for now.

1. **NYC Crash Data Cleaning**
   The NYC motor vehicle collisions data with documentation is available from
   [NYC Open
   Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).
   The raw data needs some cleaning.
    a.  Use the filter from the website to download the crash
    data of the week of June 30, 2024 in CSV format;
    save it under a directory `data` with an informative
    name (e.g., `nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20240916.csv`);
    read the data into a Panda data frame with careful
    handling of the date time variables.
    a.  Clean up the variable names. Use lower cases and replace
    spaces with underscores.
    a.  Check the crash date and time to see if they really match the
   filter we intented. Remove the extra rows if needed.	
    a.  Get the basic summaries of each variables:
    missing percentage; descriptive statistics for continuous variables;
    frequency tables for discrete variables.
    a.  Are their invalid `longitude` and `latitude` in the data?
    If so, replace them with `NA`.
    a.  Are there `zip_code` values that are not legit NYC zip codes?
    If so, replace them with `NA`.
    a.  Are there missing in `zip_code` and `borough`? Do they
    always co-occur?
    a.  Are there cases where `zip_code` and `borough` are missing
    but the geo codes are not missing? If so, fill in `zip_code`
    and `borough` using the geo codes.
    a.  Is it redundant to keep both `location` and the
    `longitude`/`latitude` at the NYC Open Data server?
    a.  Check the frequency of `crash_time` by hour. Is there a matter
    of bad luck at exactly midnight? How would you interpret this?
    a.  Are the number of persons killed/injured the summation of
    the numbers of pedestrians, cyclist, and motorists killed/injured?
    If so, is it redundant to keep these two columns at the NYC
    Open Data server?
    a.  Print the whole frequency table of
    `contributing_factor_vehicle_1`. 
    Convert lower cases to uppercases and check the frequencies again.
    a.  Provided an opportunity to meet the data provider, what
    suggestions would you make based on your data exploration
    experience?

1. **NYC Crash Data Exploration** Except for the first question, use
   the cleaned crash data in feather format.
    a.  Construct a contigency table for missing in geocode (latitude and
     longitude) by borough. Is the missing pattern the same across boroughs?
     Formulate a hypothesis and test it. 
    a.  Construct a `hour` variable with integer values from 0 to 23. Plot the
     histogram of the number of crashes by `hour`. Plot it by borough.
    a.  Overlay the locations of the crashes on a map of NYC. The map could be a
     static map or a Google map.
    a.  Create a new variable `severe` which is one if the number of persons
     injured or deaths is 1 or more; and zero otherwise. Construct a cross
     table for `severe` versus borough. Is the severity of the crashes the
     same across boroughs? Test the null hypothesis that the two variables
     are not associated with an appropriate test.
    a.  Merge the crash data with the Census zip code database which
   contains zip-code level demographic or socioeconomic variables.
    a.  Fit a logistic model with `severe` as the outcome variable and covariates
     that are available in the data or can be engineered from the data. For
     example, zip code level covariates obtained from merging with the
     zip code database; crash hour; number of vehicles involved.

1. **NYC Crash severity modeling**
   Using the cleaned NYC crash data, merged with zipcode level
   information, predict `severe` of a crash.
    a.  Set random seed to `1234`. Randomly select 20% of the
       crashes as testing data and leave the rest 80% as training
       data.
    a.  Fit a logistic model on the training data and validate the
       performance on the testing data. Explain the confusion matrix
       result from the testing data. Compute the F1 score.
    a.  Fit a logistic model on the training data with $L_1$
       regularization. Select the tuning parameter with 5-fold
       cross-validation in F1 score
	a.  Apply the regularized logistic regression to predict the
       severity of the crashes in the testing data. Compare the
	   performance of the two logistic models in terms of accuracy, 
	   precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.


1. **Midterm project: Street flood in NYC** 
   The [NYC Open Data of 311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)
   contains all service requests from 2010 to the present. This
   analysis focuses on two sewer-related complaints in 2024: Street
   Flooding (SF) and Catch Basin (CB). SF complaints serve as a
   practical indicator of street flooding, while CB complaints provide
   insights into a key infrastructural factor—when catch basins fail
   to drain rainwater properly due to blockages or structural issues,
   water accumulates on the streets. SF complaints are typically filed
   when residents observe standing water or flooding, whereas CB
   complaints report clogged basins, defective grates, or other
   drainage problems. The dataset is available in CSV format as
   `data/nycflood2024.csv`. Refer to the online data dictionary for a
   detailed explanation of variable meanings. Try to tell a story in
   your report while going through the questions.
    a.  Data cleaning.
        i.  Import the data, rename the columns with our preferred styles.
        i.  Summarize the missing information. Are there variables that
          are close to completely missing? 
        i.  Are there redundant information in the data? Try storing the
          data using the Arrow format and comment on the efficiency
          gain.
        i.  Are there invalid NYC zipcode or borough? Can some of the
          missing values be filled? Fill them if yes.
        i.  Are there date errors? Examples are earlier `closed_date`
          than `created_date`; `closed_date` and `created_date`
          matching to the second; dates exactly at midnight or noon to
          the second.
        i.  Summarize your suggestions to the data curator in several
          bullet points.
    a.  Exploratory analysis.
        i.  Visualize the locations of complaints on a NYC map, with
           different symbols for different descriptors.
        i.  Create a variable `response_time`, which is the duration
           from `created_date` to `closed_date`. 
        i.  Visualize the comparison of response time by complaint
          descriptor and borough. The original may not be the best
          given the long tail or outlers.
        i.  Is there significant difference in response time between SF
           and CB complaints? Across different boroughs? Does the
           difference between SF and CB depend on borough? State your
           hypothesis, justify your test, and summarize your results
           in plain English.
        i.  Create a binary variable `over3d` to indicate that a service
          request took three days or longer to close. 
        i.  Does `over3d`
          depend on the complaint descriptor, borough, or weekday (vs
          weekend/holiday)? State your hypotheses, justify your test,
          and summarize your results.
    a.  Modeling the occurrence of overly long response time.
        i.  Create a data set which contains the outcome variable
          `over3d` and variables that might be useful in predicting it.
          Consider including time-of-day effects (e.g., rush hour
          vs. late-night), seasonal trends, and neighborhood-level
          demographics. Zip code level information could be useful
          too, such as the zip code
         area and the ACS 2023 variables
         (`data/nyc_zip_areas.feather` and
         `data/acs2023.feather`).
        i.  Randomly select 20% of the complaints as testing data with
          seeds `1234`. Build a logistic model to predict `over3d` for
          the complaints with the training data. If you
          have tuning parameters, justify how they were selected.
        i.  Construct the confusion matrix from your prediction with a
          threshold of 1/2 on both training and testing
          data. Explain your accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score to a
          New Yorker.
        i. Construct the ROC curve of your fitted logistic model and
          obtain the AUROC for both training and testing data. Explain your
          results to a New Yorker.
        i. Identify the most important predictors of `over3d`. Use model
          coefficients or feature importance (e.g., odds ratios, standardized
          coefficients, or SHAP values).
        i. Summarize your results to a New Yorker who is not data
           science savvy in several bullet points.
    a.  Modeling the count of SF complains by zip code.
        i.  Create a data set by aggregate the count of SF and SB
           complains by day for each zipcode. 
        i.  Merge the NYC precipitation (`data/rainfall_CP.csv`), 
           by day to this data set.
        i.  Merge the NYC zip code level landscape variables
           (`data/nyc_zip_lands.csv`) and ACS 2023 variables into the
           data set.
		i. For each day, create two variables representing 1-day lag of the
           precipitation and the number of CB complaints.
        i. Filter data from March 1 to November 30, excluding winter
           months when flooding is less frequent.
           November 30. 
        i.  Compare a Poisson regression with a Negative Binomial
           regression to account for overdispersion. Which model fits better?
           Explain the results to a New Yorker.
