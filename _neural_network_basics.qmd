## Neural Network Basics

### Introducing Myself

The following was written by Ajeeth Vellore, a Mechanical Engineering graduate
student at the University of Connecticut.

The goal of this section is give a quick synopsis on neural networks: how they
came to be, how they work in basic form, and what a neural network looks like in
action. 

### What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are a bio-inspired methodology for learning information from
data, introduced as the "perceptron" by Dr. Frank Rosenblatt of Cornell in the
late 1950's.

See, the way that neurologists of the time theorized that the brain intepreted
information was by it passing through the eye to the retina, where topographic
connections would form some sort of projection layer in the cortical
regions of the brain so as to maintain the inital spatial arrangement of the 
information within the brain after being seen. Then, several layers of
processing would occur within the brain so that information could be learned and
stored to make associations between patterns that were recognized. Finally, the
information might trigger some sort of response via the motor cortex, showing
that information has been consumed by the brain and learned from. The initial
diagram for this process is shown in @fig-perceptron1:

![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/perceptron1.png)
:::

So, to mimic this behavior, Dr. Rosenblatt prosposed a computational system of
similar architecture, where sensory information of some kind would be projected
then learned by some sort of association system, which would result in a
numerical response via "response units". This framework can be seen below in
@fig-perceptron2.

![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/perceptron2.jpg)
:::

Progress on this work slowed in the 1960's due to a lack of enthusiasm around
the potential for artificial intelligence, a sentiment that continued through
the next two decades into the 1990's, when work on the processing of
backpropogation, a fundamental concept to the speedy calculation of weights in a
network, was picking up once again via the long short-term memory network in
1995, whose architecture (as shown in @fig-lstm_example) revolutionized neural
networks and became required reference material for further development in this
field.

:::{#fig-lstm_example fig-align="center" fig-cap='A long short-term memory network diagram'}
![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/lstm_example.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

This work mitigated the vanishing gradient problem, where long data sequences
could become difficult to learn from as the backpropogation required to learn
would result in forgotten information at the end of the process. Thanks to
discoveries like these as well as computational advancements throught the last
30 years that allow for greater processing capabilities, neural networks have
become commonplace in areas like machine learning. So, what I hope to do through
this page is explain what neural networks are and how they work so you can walk
away from this with a basic understanding of the concepts so that you, the
reader, can easily dive into the deeper world of machine learning. 

### Basic Building Blocks

Let's talk some fundamentals for neural networks. There are four main components
to address before we get into the math of things:

+ **Neurons**
+ **Layers**
+ **Weights**
+ **Activation Functions**

#### Neurons

These carry some sort of numerical information between 0 and 1 called an
actiavtion, represented by the individual colored dots in the image of a
sample network in Figure 4. These are the "response units" mentioned in Figure
2, meant to carry some sort of information relating to what they've learned.
Depending on a threshold, these neurons can be activated so that they are
especially highlighted as carrying some information of note.

#### Layers

These are groups of neurons that represent some set of information being learned
by a neural network. As a collective, they identify a portion of the input
information and respond to it before passing it on to further layers of nodes to
"understand" the input in some meaningful way.

#### Weights

The weights are represented by the arrows connecting between layers of nodes in
@fig-neural_network. These mathematically modify the information in each layer
to show what is important to be passed on, usually by multiplying the weight by
all of the activations of the nodes it is connected to.

![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/neural-network.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

Now, this combination of neurons, layers, and weights can be combined to make
predictions and classifications just fine. However, the complexity of the model
they form would be quite limited because what those three essentially build is a
linear regression model. Since most data is quite non-linear, these sorts of
models can fail spectacularly on data slightly more complex than what can be
explained by a linear $y = mx + b$-type equation. So, we need to resort to using
something to incorporate some non-linearity into the model, that being...

#### Activation Functions

I wanted to showcase a couple different functions that are commonly used in
neural networks to add some non-linearity, and thus better prediction ability,
to a model.

The first two are the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions, as
shown in @fig-sigmoid_tanh. 

+ **Sigmoid:** $$ \sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $$
+ **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):** $$ \tanh(x)=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} $$

```{python}
#| label: fig-sigmoid_tanh
#| fig-cap: "Graphs of the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions"
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a range of x values.
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)

# Define the activation functions.
sigmoid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
tanh = np.tanh(x)
relu = np.maximum(0, x)
alpha = 0.1  # Slope for negative x.
leaky_relu = np.where(x < 0, alpha * x, x)

### First Figure: Sigmoid and tanh

fig1, axes1 = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))  # 1 row, 2 columns

# Plot Sigmoid
axes1[0].plot(x, sigmoid, color='blue', label='Sigmoid')
axes1[0].set_title("Sigmoid Activation")
axes1[0].set_xlabel("x")
axes1[0].set_ylabel(r"$\sigma(x)$")
axes1[0].grid(True)
axes1[0].legend()

# Plot tanh
axes1[1].plot(x, tanh, color='orange', label='tanh')
axes1[1].set_title("Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)")
axes1[1].set_xlabel("x")
axes1[1].set_ylabel("tanh(x)")
axes1[1].grid(True)
axes1[1].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The functions have a similar shape, but the sigmoid function
ranges from 0 to 1, which is useful for binary classification tasks, while the
hyperbolic function is more generally applicable because it trends extremely
positive or negative through the training process and also has an extremely
large gradient, allowing for faster optimization.

The second two I want to discuss are the standard Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
and Leaky ReLU, shown in @fig-relu_leaky_relu. 

+ **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** $$\operatorname{ReLU}(x)=\max(0,x)$$
+ **Leaky ReLU:** 

  $$\operatorname{LeakyReLU}(x)=
    \begin{cases}
      x,& x\geq 0\\[2mm]
      0.01x,& x<0
    \end{cases}$$

```{python}
#| label: fig-relu_leaky_relu
#| fig-cap: "Graphs of the ReLU and Leaky ReLU functions"
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false

fig2, axes2 = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))  # 1 row, 2 columns

# Plot ReLU
axes2[0].plot(x, relu, color='green', label='ReLU')
axes2[0].set_title("ReLU Activation")
axes2[0].set_xlabel("x")
axes2[0].set_ylabel("ReLU(x)")
axes2[0].grid(True)
axes2[0].legend()

# Plot Leaky ReLU
axes2[1].plot(x, leaky_relu, color='red', label='Leaky ReLU')
axes2[1].set_title("Leaky ReLU Activation")
axes2[1].set_xlabel("x")
axes2[1].set_ylabel("LeakyReLU(x)")
axes2[1].grid(True)
axes2[1].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

They introduce non-linearity in a slightly different way that can also be useful
during the learning process. Both are quite computationally efficient; while the
ReLU function induces network sparsity, or a network that has many zero nodes
to make it lighter-weight, the Leaky ReLU preserves some of those previously
discarded nodes in the case that they are useful for training the model further
down the line beyond the training sample that is given at any one time.

Okay, so we've gathered all of the individual portions of the neural network
system. I'd now like demonstrate how they work in concert with each other.

### Calculating Activations

We can calculate activations using an equation that looks like this:

$$
\mathbf{a}^{(n+1)} = \text{func }\!\bigl(\mathbf{W}\,\mathbf{a}^{(n)} + \mathbf{b}\bigr)
$$

In this equation, each successive layer is calculated by taking the activations
of the previous layer, multiplying them by the weights that connect them to the
next layer, perhaps adding a bias term in the case it is necessary and can
be tuned during the learning process, and then finally processing the value
through any given actiavtion function. Doing this repeatedly is what is
essentially done during...

### Forward Propogation

...which is used to calculate predictions! Data will flow through a network,
activating different nodes in different layers to eventually calculate some
function, as might occur in the demonstration shown in Figure 7, with results
for every node calculated.

:::{#fig-neural_network fig-align="center" fig-cap='Example of calculated activations'}
![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/sample_network.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

In this sample network, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ represent layers of activations
(with $a_3$ being the prediction layer) while $W_1$ and $W_2$ represent the
weights that connect the aforementioned layers. In this particular scenario, the
network is attempting to perform a binary classification. This means that the
ground truth will only correspond to one of the outputs, giving it an actual
value of 1 for it being true, meaning the other will inevitably result in a 0.

In the example given, it's obvious that, while the correct prediction is
technically made, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in that response,
since the activation value is still so close to 0.5. We need to see how far off
the model is, so we compare the ground truth to the output predictions, which
might come in the form of a sum squared error calculationa form of **loss
function**. This is quite valuable, because it gives us an avenue by which we
can calculate how much to change our malleable weights in order to generate more
accurate predictions. Through decades of research, it has been found that the
best method to update these weights is...

### Backpropogation

...where weights are recalculated using a method called gradient descent. This
method seeks to minimize loss by updating weights all the way back to the first
layer by calculating the effect each value has on the final output using partial
derivatives, much like the equation shown below (which uses the variables given
in Figure 7):

$$
\frac{\partial a_3}{\partial a_1^{(l)}} = \frac{\partial w_1^{(l)}}{\partial a_1^{(l)}} \cdot \frac{\partial a_2^{(l)}}{\partial w_1^{(l)}} \cdot \frac{\partial w_2^{(l)}}{\partial a_2^{(l)}} \cdot \frac{\partial a_3}{\partial w_2^{(l)}}
$$

By repeating this strategy over several epochs (or forward- and backpropogation
runs through the dataset), the model can train itself to learn fairly complex
information. To demonstrate this capability, let's look at a dataset very
commonly used to test neural networks and their capabilities in prediction.

### Neural Network Example with the MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a modified version of a dataset that comes from the
National Institute of Standards and Technology based on images of handwritten
numbers between 0-9 that are paired with classifications of each. An example of
a number from this dataset can be seen below in Figure 8:

:::{#fig-neural_network fig-align="center" fig-cap='A handwritten 3 from the MNIST dataset'}
![](images/neural_network_basics_visuals/Example-of-a-MNIST-input-An-image-is-passed-to-the-network-as-a-matrix-of-28-by-28.png){fig-align="center" .fragment}
:::

This is a black-and-white square $28*28$ image, thus comprised of 784 pixels in
its entirety. This size is the same across all 70,000 samples in the dataset to
maintain uniformity and makes it easy for us to build a simple neural network
to predict what class each image belongs to.

So, let's begin by calling the three packages required for building our neural
network:

```{python}
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

The `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` modules are self-explanatory, since they are
quite commonly used for manipulating and presenting data in Python. Now, the
`tensorflow` module contains packages that allow for the easy building of a
neural network via `keras`. Conveniently, `keras` also contains the MNIST
dataset in a manner that is easily called, making it very simple to build the
full model while splitting the dataset in preparation for the learning process:

```{python}
# loading MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# normalize RGB values
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test  = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28)
x_test  = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28)

# using keras for building model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(shape=(28*28,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```

You'll note that the model has one input layer, shaped as 28*28 to represent all
784 pixels indiviually as inputs to the model. Then, there are three Dense
layers: the first two are ReLU-actiavted and contain 64 nodes, and the last only
contains 10 nodes while being softmax-activated. Admittedly, the choices for
number of middle layers and nodes for those middle layers is quite arbitrary in
this demonstration, since this decision is dependent entirely on whether or not
the system the code is being run on has enough computational power to process
more or less nodes and layers. However, the choice of 10 nodes for the final
layer is controlled entirely by the predictions we want to make, as there are
ten classes that correspond to the ten possible numbers that can appear in the
MNIST dataset, and the choice of the softmax function here is to highlight the
largest value among the 10 nodes as the final prediction.

```{python}
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Now we compile the model, setting its optimizer to `adam` and its loss function
to `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` which calculates based on accuracy.
To nutshell the above codeblock, what this essentially does is set the model to
be optimized using a highly-effective and memory-efficient gradient-based method
using an equation widely accepted to be effective for multi-class classification
tasks. Now, we can began the learning process and test on some samples
afterwards:

```{python}
#| label: fig-neural_network_demo
#| fig-cap: "Training and validation accuracy of handwritten number prediction model"
#| fig-align: center
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, 
                    epochs=5,           
                    batch_size=32,      
                    validation_split=0.1,
                    verbose=0)

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print("Test accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(test_acc * 100))

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title("Training and Validation Accuracy")
plt.xlabel("Epoch")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

On a limited amount of epochs (or training runs through the entire dataset), the
accuracy on the MNIST dataset is quite high (as can be seen in
@fig-neural_network_demo), showing that a model like this can indeed work to
learn information from images to generate predictions.

#### Pros and Cons

So we've seen that a neural network can work for learning information, but what
are the benefits and drawbacks of using a system like this? In other words, what
should you associate neural networks with so that you can decide whether or not
to use them in your own data analytics applications? Here are few points that
should be considered:

**PROS:**

+ **Able to identify complex relationships**: A lot of data that exists today is
quite non-linear in nature. Because of this, it is very important that a
learning model be innately capable of capturing that non-linearity to make
accurate predictions, which neural networks are thanks to the interchangability
of non-linear activation and loss functions.

+ **Learns underlying features from raw data not easily seen by humans**: This
benefit can be combined with the previous point to emphasize the fact that the
reason we humans use models in the first place is because they can visualize
patterns that we can't see with our naked eyes. Neural networks, because of how
good they are at understanding all sorts of data, can do an immense job of
finding meaning in data that we might find incomprehensible.

+ **Flexible and versatile**: Neural networks have been used in thousands of
different scenarios to learn and predict thousands of different things. Because
of the bio-inspired nature of the perceptron, it is capable of learning lots of
information the way humans can, meaning that even if there is a scenario where
neural networks have not been tried, there is a high likelihood that they could
still be very useful in that scenario.

**CONS:**

+ **Requires large datasets to learn effectively**: Most machine learning models
require a significant amount of data to learn sufficiently for accurate
predictions. Though it was not explicitly stated above, the MNIST training
dataset was 60,000 data samples. This size easily allowed for the model to
quickly and efficiently learn well: however, if the dataset you have in front of
you is significantly smaller than that, a neural network may not be a good
choice.

+ **Computationally intensive**: The example given in the demonstration section 
is hardly a problem for most modern computers to run. However, as the complexity
of data increases, necessitating more layers and weights, significantly more
powerful hardware is required to identify all of the intricacies of the dataset.

+ **Not interpretable**: This may be the biggest drawback to using a neural
network for any task. Though we know the equations that go into building a 
neural network in general, it is incredibly difficult to see how one sample in a
dataset has an effect on all of its trainable parameters, and as such, we in the
machine learning field typically call neural networks "black boxes", since the
manner by which they learn is opaque to us. This can be undesirable for learning
tasks where the model predicts something that would normally warrant a
scientific or detailed explanation.

Hopefully, this section on neural networks gives you a good idea of what they
are, how they work, and where they might be used. This should hopefully give you
enough information to proceed forward and learn about neural networks in more
depth for whatever application you want to use them for. Here are some great
resources that you can use to learn more about them:
