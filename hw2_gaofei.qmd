# Contributing to the Class Notes

This document explains how to contribute to the class notes repository. The steps include forking, cloning, rendering, making changes, and submitting a pull request.

---

## **Step 1: Fork the Repository**
First, we fork the official **class notes repository** to our own GitHub account.

- Go to: [https://github.com/statds/ids-s25](https://github.com/statds/ids-s25)
- Click **Fork** (top-right corner).
- Now we have a copy in our GitHub account.

---

## **Step 2: Clone the Repository**
Next, we clone the forked repository to our local machine.


# Move to the directory where we want to clone
```{bash}
cd /d/UConn/git
```

# Clone the forked repository (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME)
```{bash}
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ids-s25.git
```

# Move into the cloned directory
```{bash}
cd ids-s25
```

## **Step 3: Render the Class Notes**
Once cloned, we render the class notes to ensure everything works correctly.

Setup Python Environment

# Create a virtual environment

```{bash}
python -m venv venv
```

# Activate the virtual environment
```{bash}
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows users
```

Install Dependencies

```{bash}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Quarto Render

```{bash}
quarto render
```

## **Step 4: Add wishlist**
Open wishlist.qmd

## Wishlist

```{bash}

# save code

Press CTRL + X in nano, enter Y to save, and press Enter to exit.

First check which branch you are currently in:

```{bash}
git branch
```
If the output is:
* main
It means that you have not created the add-wishlist-item branch. 
The correct way is:

```{bash}
git checkout -b add-wishlist-item
```
This command will:
Create the add-wishlist-item branch
Switch to the new branch

Expected output:

Switched to a new branch 'add-wishlist-item'

Make sure the changes are still there
Run:
```{bash}
git status
```
If wishlist.qmd shows that the changes have been submitted, 
you can jump directly to Step 5.

If wishlist.qmd has not been modified (it has become clean), 
you need to resubmit it:
```{bash}
git add wishlist.qmd
git commit -m "Added gaofei's wishlist items"
git push origin add-wishlist-item
```


## **Step 5: The goal now is to submit the hw2_gaofei.qmd file to the main branch and push it to GitHub. 
Follow these steps:
Make sure you are on the main branch
First check which branch you are currently on:

```{bash}
git branch
```
If the output is:
* main
It means you are already on the main branch. 
If not, switch back to main:

```{bash}
git checkout main
```

Make sure hw2_gaofei.qmd exists
Run:
```{bash}
git status
```
If hw2_gaofei.qmd is shown as untracked or modified, continue to Step 6.
If it is not in git status, check if it is in the correct directory:
```{bash}
ls -l hw2_gaofei.qmd
```
If the file is not in the current directory, 
you may be in the wrong folder and need to cd to the ids-s25 directory:
```{bash}
cd /d/UConn/git/ids-s25
```

## **Step 6: Unlock hw2_gaofei.qmd in main
```{bash}
git checkout main
git add hw2_gaofei.qmd
git commit -m "Added HW2 solution"
```
