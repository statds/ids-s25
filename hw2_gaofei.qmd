# Contributing to the Class Notes

This document explains how to contribute to the class notes repository. The steps include forking, cloning, rendering, making changes, and submitting a pull request.

---

## **Step 1: Fork the Repository**
First, we fork the official **class notes repository** to our own GitHub account.

- Go to: [https://github.com/statds/ids-s25](https://github.com/statds/ids-s25)
- Click **Fork** (top-right corner).
- Now we have a copy in our GitHub account.

---

## **Step 2: Clone the Repository**
Next, we clone the forked repository to our local machine.


# Move to the directory where we want to clone
```{bash}
cd /d/UConn/git
```

# Clone the forked repository (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME)
```{bash}
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ids-s25.git
```

# Move into the cloned directory
```{bash}
cd ids-s25
```

## **Step 3: Render the Class Notes**
Once cloned, we render the class notes to ensure everything works correctly.

Setup Python Environment

# Create a virtual environment

```{bash}
python -m venv venv
```

# Activate the virtual environment
```{bash}
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows users
```

Install Dependencies

```{bash}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Quarto Render

```{bash}
quarto render
```

## **Step 4: Create a New Branch**
Before making any changes, we create a new branch.

# Ensure we are on the latest version of the main branch
```{bash}
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

# Create a new branch for our changes
```{bash}
git checkout -b add-wishlist-item
```
