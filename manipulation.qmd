# Data Manipulation

## Introduction

Data manipulation is crucial for transforming raw data into a
more analyzable format, essential for uncovering patterns and
ensuring accurate analysis. This chapter introduces the core
techniques for data manipulation in Python, utilizing the Pandas
library, a cornerstone for data handling within Python's data
science toolkit.


Python's ecosystem is rich with libraries that facilitate not
just data manipulation but comprehensive data analysis. Pandas,
in particular, provides extensive functionality for data
manipulation tasks including reading, cleaning, transforming,
and summarizing data. Using real-world datasets, we will explore
how to leverage Python for practical data manipulation tasks.


By the end of this chapter, you will learn to:

- Import/export data from/to diverse sources.
- Clean and preprocess data efficiently.
- Transform and aggregate data to derive insights.
- Merge and concatenate datasets from various origins.
- Analyze real-world datasets using these techniques.

## Example: NYC Crash Data

Consider a subset of the NYC Crash Data, which contains all
NYC motor vehicle collisions data with documentation from
[NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).
We downloaded the crash data for the week of June 30, 2024,
on February 12, 2025, in CSC format.
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20250212.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path,
                 dtype={'LATITUDE': np.float32,
                        'LONGITUDE': np.float32,
                        'ZIP CODE': str})

# Replace column names: convert to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()
```


Take a peek at the first five rows:
```{python}
df.head()
```


A quick summary of the data types of the columns:
```{python}
df.info()
```


Now we can do some cleaning after a quick browse.
```{python}
# Replace invalid coordinates (latitude=0, longitude=0 or NaN) with NaN
df.loc[(df['latitude'] == 0) & (df['longitude'] == 0), 
       ['latitude', 'longitude']] = pd.NA
df['latitude'] = df['latitude'].replace(0, pd.NA)
df['longitude'] = df['longitude'].replace(0, pd.NA)

# Drop the redundant `latitute` and `longitude` columns
df = df.drop(columns=['location'])

# Converting 'crash_date' and 'crash_time' columns into a single datetime column
df['crash_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['crash_date'] + ' ' 
                       + df['crash_time'], format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M', errors='coerce')

# Drop the original 'crash_date' and 'crash_time' columns
df = df.drop(columns=['crash_date', 'crash_time'])
```

Let's get some basic frequency tables of `borough` and `zip_code`,
whose values could be used to check their validity against the
legitmate values.
```{python}
# Frequency table for 'borough' without filling missing values
borough_freq = df['borough'].value_counts(dropna=False).reset_index()
borough_freq.columns = ['borough', 'count']

# Frequency table for 'zip_code' without filling missing values
zip_code_freq = df['zip_code'].value_counts(dropna=False).reset_index()
zip_code_freq.columns = ['zip_code', 'count']
zip_code_freq
```

A comprehensive list of ZIP codes by borough can be obtained, for
example, from [the New York City Department of Health's UHF
Codes](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ah/zipcodetable.pdf). 
We can use this list to check the validity of the zip codes in the
data.
```{python}
# List of valid NYC ZIP codes compiled from UHF codes
# Define all_valid_zips based on the earlier extracted ZIP codes
all_valid_zips = {
    10463, 10471, 10466, 10469, 10470, 10475, 10458, 10467, 10468,
    10461, 10462, 10464, 10465, 10472, 10473, 10453, 10457, 10460,
    10451, 10452, 10456, 10454, 10455, 10459, 10474, 11211, 11222,
    11201, 11205, 11215, 11217, 11231, 11213, 11212, 11216, 11233,
    11238, 11207, 11208, 11220, 11232, 11204, 11218, 11219, 11230,
    11203, 11210, 11225, 11226, 11234, 11236, 11239, 11209, 11214,
    11228, 11223, 11224, 11229, 11235, 11206, 11221, 11237, 10031,
    10032, 10033, 10034, 10040, 10026, 10027, 10030, 10037, 10039,
    10029, 10035, 10023, 10024, 10025, 10021, 10028, 10044, 10128,
    10001, 10011, 10018, 10019, 10020, 10036, 10010, 10016, 10017,
    10022, 10012, 10013, 10014, 10002, 10003, 10009, 10004, 10005,
    10006, 10007, 10038, 10280, 11101, 11102, 11103, 11104, 11105,
    11106, 11368, 11369, 11370, 11372, 11373, 11377, 11378, 11354,
    11355, 11356, 11357, 11358, 11359, 11360, 11361, 11362, 11363,
    11364, 11374, 11375, 11379, 11385, 11365, 11366, 11367, 11414,
    11415, 11416, 11417, 11418, 11419, 11420, 11421, 11412, 11423,
    11432, 11433, 11434, 11435, 11436, 11004, 11005, 11411, 11413,
    11422, 11426, 11427, 11428, 11429, 11691, 11692, 11693, 11694,
    11695, 11697, 10302, 10303, 10310, 10301, 10304, 10305, 10314,
    10306, 10307, 10308, 10309, 10312
}

    
# Convert set to list of strings
all_valid_zips = list(map(str, all_valid_zips))

# Identify invalid ZIP codes (including NaN)
invalid_zips = df[
    df['zip_code'].isna() | ~df['zip_code'].isin(all_valid_zips)
    ]['zip_code']

# Calculate frequency of invalid ZIP codes
invalid_zip_freq = invalid_zips.value_counts(dropna=False).reset_index()
invalid_zip_freq.columns = ['zip_code', 'frequency']

invalid_zip_freq
```

As it turns out, the collection of valid NYC zip codes differ from
different sources. From [United States Zip
Codes](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/), `10065` appears to be a
valid NYC zip code. Under this circumstance, it might be safer to not
remove any zip code from the data.


To be safe, let's concatenate valid and invalid zips.
```{python}
# Convert invalid ZIP codes to a set of strings
invalid_zips_set = set(invalid_zip_freq['zip_code'].dropna().astype(str))

# Convert all_valid_zips to a set of strings (if not already)
valid_zips_set = set(map(str, all_valid_zips))

# Merge both sets
merged_zips = invalid_zips_set | valid_zips_set  # Union of both sets
```

Are missing in zip code and borough always co-occur?
```{python}
# Check if missing values in 'zip_code' and 'borough' always co-occur
# Count rows where both are missing
missing_cooccur = df[['zip_code', 'borough']].isnull().all(axis=1).sum()
# Count total missing in 'zip_code' and 'borough', respectively
total_missing_zip_code = df['zip_code'].isnull().sum()
total_missing_borough = df['borough'].isnull().sum()

# If missing in both columns always co-occur, the number of missing
# co-occurrences should be equal to the total missing in either column
np.array([missing_cooccur, total_missing_zip_code, total_missing_borough])
```

Are there cases where zip_code and borough are missing
but the geo codes are not missing? If so, fill in `zip_code`
and `borough` using the geo codes by reverse geocoding.

First make sure `geopy` is installed.
``` shell
pip install geopy
```

Now we use model `Nominatim` in package `geopy` to reverse geocode.
```{python}
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
import time

# Initialize the geocoder; the `user_agent` is your identifier 
# when using the service. Be mindful not to crash the server
# by unlimited number of queries, especially invalid code.
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="jyGeopyTry")
```

We write a function to do the reverse geocoding given
lattitude and longitude.
```{python}
# Function to fill missing zip_code
def get_zip_code(latitude, longitude):
    try:
        location = geolocator.reverse((latitude, longitude), timeout=10)
        if location:
            address = location.raw['address']
            zip_code = address.get('postcode', None)
            return zip_code
        else:
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e} for coordinates {latitude}, {longitude}")
        return None
    finally:
        time.sleep(1)  # Delay to avoid overwhelming the service
```

Let's try it out:
```{python}
# Example usage
latitude = 40.730610
longitude = -73.935242
get_zip_code(latitude, longitude)
```

The function `get_zip_code` can then be applied to
rows where zip code is missing but geocodes are not to
fill the missing zip code.

Once zip code is known, figuring out `burough` is simple
because valid zip codes from each borough are known.


## Accessing Census Data

The U.S. Census Bureau provides extensive demographic, economic, and 
social data through multiple surveys, including the decennial Census, 
the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Economic Census. These 
datasets offer valuable insights into population trends, economic 
conditions, and community characteristics at multiple geographic levels.

There are several ways to access Census data:

- **Census API**: The [Census API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) 
  allows programmatic access to various datasets. It supports queries 
  for different geographic levels and time periods.
- **data.census.gov**: The official [web interface](https://data.census.gov/) 
  for searching and downloading Census data.
- **IPUMS USA**: Provides harmonized microdata for longitudinal 
  research. Available at [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/).
- **NHGIS**: Offers historical Census data with geographic information. 
  Visit [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/).

In addition, Python tools simplify API access and data retrieval.

### Python Tools for Accessing Census Data

Several Python libraries facilitate Census data retrieval:

- `censusapi`: The 
  [official API wrapper](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/census-api) 
  for direct access to Census datasets.
- `census`: A high-level interface to the Census API, supporting ACS 
  and decennial Census queries. See 
  [census on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/census/).
- `censusdata`: A package for downloading and processing Census data 
  directly in Python. Available at 
  [censusdata documentation](https://jtleider.github.io/censusdata/).
- `uszipcode`: A library for retrieving Census and geographic 
  information by ZIP code. See 
  [uszipcode on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/).

### Zip-Code Level for NYC Crash Data

Now that we have NYC crash data, we might want to analyze patterns at 
the zip-code level to understand whether certain demographic or 
economic factors correlate with traffic incidents. While the crash 
dataset provides details about individual accidents, such as location, 
time, and severity, it does not contain contextual information about 
the neighborhoods where these crashes occur. 


To perform meaningful zip-code-level analysis, we need additional data 
sources that provide relevant demographic, economic, and geographic 
variables. For example, understanding whether high-income areas 
experience fewer accidents, or whether population density influences 
crash frequency, requires integrating Census data. Key variables such 
as population size, median household income, employment rate, and 
population density can provide valuable context for interpreting crash
trends across different zip codes. 


Since the Census Bureau provides detailed estimates for these variables 
at the zip-code level, we can use the Census API or other tools to 
retrieve relevant data and merge it with the NYC crash dataset. To 
access the Census API, you need an API key, which is free and easy to 
obtain. Visit the [Census API Request page](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) 
and submit your email address to receive a key. Once you have the key, 
you must include it in your API requests to access Census data. The
following demonstration assumes that you have registered, obtained
your API key, and saved it in a file called `censusAPIkey.txt`.


```{python}
# Import modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
from census import Census
from us import states
import os
import io

api_key = open("censusAPIkey.txt").read().strip()
c = Census(api_key)
```


Suppose that we want to get some basic info from ACS data of the year
of 2023 for all the NYC zip codes. The variable names can be found in
the [ACS variable documentation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-shells.html).
```{python}
ACS_YEAR = 2023
ACS_DATASET = "acs/acs5"

# Important ACS variables (including land area for density calculation)
ACS_VARIABLES = {
    "B01003_001E": "Total Population",
    "B19013_001E": "Median Household Income",
    "B02001_002E": "White Population",
    "B02001_003E": "Black Population",
    "B02001_005E": "Asian Population",
    "B15003_022E": "Bachelor’s Degree Holders",
    "B15003_025E": "Graduate Degree Holders",
    "B23025_002E": "Labor Force",
    "B23025_005E": "Unemployed",
    "B25077_001E": "Median Home Value"
}

# Convert set to list of strings
merged_zips = list(map(str, merged_zips))
```

Let's set up the query to request the ACS data, and process the
returned data.
```{python}
acs_data = c.acs5.get(
    list(ACS_VARIABLES.keys()), 
    {'for': f'zip code tabulation area:{",".join(merged_zips)}'}
    )

# Convert to DataFrame
df_acs = pd.DataFrame(acs_data)

# Rename columns
df_acs.rename(columns=ACS_VARIABLES, inplace=True)
df_acs.rename(columns={"zip code tabulation area": "ZIP Code"}, inplace=True)
```


We could save the ACS data `df_acs` in feather format (see next Section).
``` python
#| eval: false
df_acs.to_feather("data/acs2023.feather")
```

The population density could be an important factor for crash
likelihood. To obtain the population densities, we need the areas of
the zip codes. The shape files can be obtained from NYC Open Data.

```{python}
import requests
import zipfile
import geopandas as gpd

# Define the NYC MODZCTA shapefile URL and extraction directory
shapefile_url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/pri4-ifjk?method=export&format=Shapefile"
extract_dir = "MODZCTA_Shapefile"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(extract_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Step 1: Download and extract the shapefile
print("Downloading MODZCTA shapefile...")
response = requests.get(shapefile_url)
with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content), "r") as z:
    z.extractall(extract_dir)

print(f"Shapefile extracted to: {extract_dir}")
```

Now we process the shape file to calculate the areas of the polygons.
```{python}
# Step 2: Automatically detect the correct .shp file
shapefile_path = None
for file in os.listdir(extract_dir):
    if file.endswith(".shp"):
        shapefile_path = os.path.join(extract_dir, file)
        break  # Use the first .shp file found

if not shapefile_path:
    raise FileNotFoundError("No .shp file found in extracted directory.")

print(f"Using shapefile: {shapefile_path}")

# Step 3: Load the shapefile into GeoPandas
gdf = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)

# Step 4: Convert to CRS with meters for accurate area calculation
gdf = gdf.to_crs(epsg=3857)

# Step 5: Compute land area in square miles
gdf['land_area_sq_miles'] = gdf['geometry'].area / 2_589_988.11
# 1 square mile = 2,589,988.11 square meters

print(gdf[['modzcta', 'land_area_sq_miles']].head())
```

Let's export this data frame for future usage in feather format (see
next Section).
```{python}
#| eval: false
gdf[['modzcta', 'land_area_sq_miles']].to_feather('data/nyc_zip_areas.feather')
```

Now we are ready to merge the two data frames.
```{python}
# Merge ACS data (`df_acs`) directly with MODZCTA land area (`gdf`)
gdf = gdf.merge(df_acs, left_on='modzcta', right_on='ZIP Code', how='left')

# Calculate Population Density (people per square mile)
gdf['popdensity_per_sq_mile'] = (
    gdf['Total Population'] / gdf['land_area_sq_miles']
    )

# Display first few rows
print(gdf[['modzcta', 'Total Population', 'land_area_sq_miles',
    'popdensity_per_sq_mile']].head())
```

Some visualization of population density.
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import geopandas as gpd

# Set up figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 12))

# Plot the choropleth map
gdf.plot(column='popdensity_per_sq_mile', 
         cmap='viridis',  # Use a visually appealing color map
         linewidth=0.8, 
         edgecolor='black',
         legend=True,
         legend_kwds={'label': "Population Density (per sq mile)",
             'orientation': "horizontal"},
         ax=ax)

# Add a title
ax.set_title("Population Density by ZCTA in NYC", fontsize=14)

# Remove axes
ax.set_xticks([])
ax.set_yticks([])
ax.set_frame_on(False)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Cross-platform Data Format `Arrow`

The CSV format (and related formats like TSV - tab-separated values)
for data tables is ubiquitous, convenient, and can be read or written
by many different data analysis environments, including spreadsheets.
An advantage of the textual representation of the data in a CSV file 
is that the entire data table, or portions of it, can be previewed
in a text editor. However, the textual representation can be ambiguous
and inconsistent. The format of a particular column: Boolean, integer,
floating-point, text, factor, etc. must be inferred from text
representation, often at the expense of reading the entire file
before these inferences can be made. Experienced data scientists are aware
that a substantial part of an analysis or report generation is often
the "data cleaning" involved in preparing the data for analysis. This
can be an open-ended task --- it required numerous trial-and-error
iterations to create the list of different missing data
representations we use for the sample CSV file and even now we are
not sure we have them all.

To read and export data efficiently, leveraging the Apache `Arrow`
library can significantly improve performance and storage efficiency,
especially with large datasets. The IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
file format in the context of Apache Arrow is a key component for
efficiently sharing data between different processes, potentially
written in different programming languages. Arrow's IPC mechanism is
designed around two main file formats:

+ Stream Format: For sending an arbitrary length sequence of Arrow
  record batches (tables). The stream format is useful for real-time
  data exchange where the size of the data is not known upfront and can
  grow indefinitely.
+ File (or Feather) Format: Optimized for storage and memory-mapped
  access, allowing for fast random access to different sections of the
  data. This format is ideal for scenarios where the entire dataset is
  available upfront and can be stored in a file system for repeated
  reads and writes.


Apache Arrow provides a columnar
memory format for flat and hierarchical data, optimized for efficient
data analytics. It can be used in Python through the `pyarrow`
package. Here's how you can use Arrow to read, manipulate, and export
data, including a demonstration of storage savings.


First, ensure you have `pyarrow` installed on your computer (and
preferrably, in your current virtual environment):
``` shell
pip install pyarrow
```

Feather is a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for
storing data frames, optimized for speed and efficiency, particularly
for IPC and data sharing between Python and R or Julia.


The following code processes the cleaned data in CSV format from
Mohammad Mundiwala and write out in Arrow format.

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd

# Read CSV, ensuring 'zip_code' is string and 'crash_datetime' is parsed as datetime
df = pd.read_csv('data/nyc_crashes_cleaned_mm.csv',
                 dtype={'zip_code': str},
                 parse_dates=['crash_datetime'])

# Drop the 'date' and 'time' columns
df = df.drop(columns=['crash_date', 'crash_time'])

# Move 'crash_datetime' to the first column
df = df[['crash_datetime'] + df.drop(columns=['crash_datetime']).columns.tolist()]

df['zip_code'] = df['zip_code'].astype(str).str.rstrip('.0')

df = df.sort_values(by='crash_datetime')

df.to_feather('nyccrashes_cleaned.feather')
```

Let's compare the file sizes of the feather format and the CSV format.

```{python}
import os

# File paths
csv_file = 'data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20250212.csv'
feather_file = 'data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather'

# Get file sizes in bytes
csv_size = os.path.getsize(csv_file)
feather_size = os.path.getsize(feather_file)

# Convert bytes to a more readable format (e.g., MB)
csv_size_mb = csv_size / (1024 * 1024)
feather_size_mb = feather_size / (1024 * 1024)

# Print the file sizes
print(f"CSV file size: {csv_size_mb:.2f} MB")
print(f"Feather file size: {feather_size_mb:.2f} MB")
```

Read the feather file back in:
``` python
#| eval: false
dff = pd.read_feather("data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather")
dff.shape
```
