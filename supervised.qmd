# Supervised Learning

## Decision Trees: Foundation

Decision trees are widely used supervised learning models that predict 
the value of a target variable by iteratively splitting the dataset 
based on decision rules derived from input features. The model 
functions as a piecewise constant approximation of the target 
function, producing clear, interpretable rules that are easily 
visualized and analyzed [@breiman1984classification]. Decision trees 
are fundamental in both classification and regression tasks, serving 
as the building blocks for more advanced ensemble models such as 
Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.


### Algorithm Formulation


The core mechanism of a decision tree algorithm is the identification 
of optimal splits that partition the data into subsets that are 
increasingly homogeneous with respect to the target variable. At any 
node $m$, the data subset is denoted as $Q_m$ with a sample size of 
$n_m$. The objective is to find a candidate split $\theta$, defined 
as a threshold for a given feature, that minimizes an impurity or 
loss measure $H$.

When a split is made at node $m$, the data is divided into two 
subsets: $Q_{m,l}$ (left node) with sample size $n_{m,l}$, and 
$Q_{m,r}$ (right node) with sample size $n_{m,r}$. The split 
quality, measured by $G(Q_m, \theta)$, is given by:

$$
G(Q_m, \theta) = \frac{n_{m,l}}{n_m} H(Q_{m,l}(\theta)) + 
\frac{n_{m,r}}{n_m} H(Q_{m,r}(\theta)).
$$

The algorithm aims to identify the split that minimizes the impurity:

$$
\theta^* = \arg\min_{\theta} G(Q_m, \theta).
$$

This process is applied recursively at each child node until a 
stopping condition is met.

+ Stopping Criteria: 
  The algorithm stops when the maximum tree depth is reached or when
  the node sample size falls below a preset threshold.
+ Pruning: 
  Reduce the complexity of the final tree by removing
  branches that add little predictive value. This reduces overfitting
  and improves the generalization accuracy of the model.

### Search Space for Possible Splits

At each node in the decision tree, the search space for possible splits 
comprises all features in the dataset and potential thresholds derived 
from the values of each feature. For a given feature, the algorithm 
considers each unique value in the current node's subset as a possible 
split point. The potential thresholds are typically set as midpoints 
between consecutive unique values, ensuring the data is partitioned 
effectively.

Formally, let the feature set be $\{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\}$, where 
$p$ is the total number of features, and let the unique values of 
feature $ X_j $ at node $ m $ be denoted by 
$\{v_{j,1}, v_{j,2}, \ldots, v_{j,k_j}\} $. The search space at node
$m$ includes:


- Feature candidates: $\{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\}$.
- Threshold candidates for $X_j$: 
  $$
  \left\{ \frac{v_{j,i} + v_{j,i+1}}{2} \mid 1 \leq i < k_j \right\}.
  $$

The search space therefore encompasses all combinations of features and 
their respective thresholds. While the complexity of this search can be 
substantial, particularly for high-dimensional data or features with 
numerous unique values, efficient algorithms use sorting and single-pass 
scanning techniques to mitigate the computational cost.


### Metrics

#### Classification
In decision tree classification, several criteria can be used to
measure the quality of a split at each node. These criteria are based
on how "pure" the resulting nodes are after the split. A pure node
contains samples that predominantly belong to a single class. The goal
is to minimize impurity, leading to nodes that are as homogeneous as
possible.

+ Gini Index: The Gini index measures the impurity of a node by
  calculating the probability of randomly choosing two different
  classes. A perfect split (all instances belong to one class) has a
  Gini index of 0. At node $m$, the Gini index is
  $$
  H(Q_m) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{mk} (1 - p_{mk}),
  $$
  where $p_{mk}$ is the proportion of samples of class $k$ at node $m$;
  and$K$ is the total number of classes
  The Gini index is often preferred for its speed and simplicity, and
  it’s used by default in many implementations of decision trees,
  including `sklearn`.

+ Entropy (Information Gain): Entropy is another measure of impurity,
  derived from information theory. It quantifies the "disorder" of the
  data at a node. Lower entropy means higher purity. At node $m$, it
  is defined as
  $$
  H(Q_m) = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{mk} \log p_{mk}
  $$
  Entropy is commonly used in decision tree algorithms like ID3 and
  C4.5. The choice between Gini and entropy often depends on specific
  use cases, but both perform similarly in practice.
  
+ Misclassification Error: Misclassification error focuses solely on
  the most frequent class in the node. It measures the proportion of
  samples that do not belong to the majority class. Although less
  sensitive than Gini and entropy, it can be useful for classification
  when simplicity is preferred. At node $m$, it is defined as
  $$
  H(Q_m) = 1 - \max_k p_{mk},
  $$
  where $\max_k p_{mk}$ is the largest proportion of samples belonging
  to any class $k$.

#### Regression Criteria

In decision tree regression, different criteria are used to assess the
quality of a split. The goal is to minimize the spread or variance of
the target variable within each node.

+ Mean Squared Error (MSE): Mean squared error is the most common
  criterion used in regression trees. It measures the average squared
  difference between the actual values and the predicted values (mean
  of the target in the node). The smaller the MSE, the better the
  fit. At node $m$, it is 
  $$
  H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{i=1}^{n_m} (y_i - \bar{y}_m)^2,
  $$
  where
    - $y_i$ is the actual value for sample $i$;
    - $\bar{y}_m$ is the mean value of the target at node $m$;
    - $n_m$ is the number of samples at node $m$.

  MSE works well when the target is continuous and normally distributed.

+ Half Poisson Deviance (for count targets): When dealing with count
  data, the Poisson deviance is used to model the variance in the
  number of occurrences of an event. It is well-suited for target
  variables representing counts (e.g., number of occurrences of an
  event). At node $m$, it is
  $$
  H(Q_m) = \sum_{i=1}^{n_m} \left( y_i \log\left(\frac{y_i}{\hat{y}_i}\right) - (y_i - \hat{y}_i) \right),
  $$
  where $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted count. This criterion is
  especially useful when the target variable represents discrete
  counts, such as predicting the number of occurrences of an event.

+ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Mean absolute error is another criterion
  that minimizes the absolute differences between actual and predicted
  values. While it is more robust to outliers than MSE, it is slower
  computationally due to the lack of a closed-form solution for
  minimization. At node $m$, it is
  $$
  H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{i=1}^{n_m} |y_i - \bar{y}_m|.
  $$
  MAE is useful when you want to minimize large deviations and can be
  more robust in cases where outliers are present in the data.

#### Summary

In decision trees, the choice of splitting criterion depends on the
type of task (classification or regression) and the nature of the
data. For classification tasks, the Gini index and entropy are the
most commonly used, with Gini offering simplicity and speed, and
entropy providing a more theoretically grounded
approach. Misclassification error can be used for simpler cases. For
regression tasks, MSE is the most popular choice, but Poisson deviance
and MAE are useful for specific use cases such as count data and
robust models, respectively.


## Boosted Trees


Boosted trees are a powerful ensemble technique in machine learning 
that combine multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, into a 
strong learner. Unlike bagging methods, which train trees 
independently, boosting fits models sequentially, with each new model 
correcting the errors of the previous ensemble. Gradient boosting, one 
of the most popular variants, optimizes a loss function by iteratively 
adding trees that reduce the residual errors of the current ensemble. 



### Introduction

Boosted trees build on the general concept of boosting, which aims to 
create a strong predictor from a series of weak predictors. In boosted 
trees, the weak learners are shallow decision trees, often referred to 
as "stumps," and they are added sequentially to the model. At each 
step, a new tree focuses on the training instances that are hardest to 
predict, improving overall accuracy. This iterative focus on "hard-to-
predict" instances is the defining characteristic of boosting.

The effectiveness of boosted trees has made them popular for various 
tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking. They also 
form the foundation for algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and 
CatBoost, known for their speed and scalability.

### Boosting Process

The boosting process in gradient boosted trees builds an ensemble by 
adding trees iteratively, each designed to minimize the residual 
errors from the combined predictions of the previous trees. This 
iterative approach allows the model to refine its predictions by 
optimizing a loss function, denoted as $L(y, F(x))$, where $y$ is the 
true value and $F(x)$ is the model's prediction.

#### Model Iteration

The boosting process can be delineated as follows:

1. **Initialization**: 
   Start with a base model $F_0(x)$, which is usually the mean of the 
   target variable in regression or the log odds in classification:

   - For regression: $F_0(x) = \text{mean}(y_i)$.
   - For classification: 
   $F_0(x) = \log \left( \frac{P(y=1)}{1-P(y=1)} \right)$.

2. **Iterative Boosting**:
   
   At each iteration $m$:
   
   - Compute the pseudo-residuals, representing the negative 
     gradient of the loss function with respect to the current model 
     predictions. The residuals at iteration $m$ are defined as:
     
     $$
     r_i^{(m)} = -\left. \frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}
     {\partial F(x_i)} \right|_{F(x) = F_{m-1}(x)}.
     $$
     
     The residuals guide the next tree to focus on reducing the 
     largest errors from the previous iteration.

   - Fit a new tree $h_m(x)$ to the pseudo-residuals. The new 
     tree is trained to predict the residuals of the current ensemble 
     model, identifying where the model needs the most improvement.

   - Update the model as the sum of the previous model and the newly 
     added tree, scaled by a learning rate $\eta$:
     
     $$
     F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta \, h_m(x).
     $$
     
     The learning rate, a small positive number (e.g., 0.01 to 0.1), 
     controls the contribution of each tree, ensuring incremental 
     improvements and reducing the risk of overfitting.

3. **Final Model**:
   
   After $M$ iterations, the ensemble model is given by:

   $$
   F_M(x) = F_0(x) + \sum_{m=1}^M \eta \, h_m(x).
   $$

   The final model $F_M(x)$ represents the sum of the initial model 
   and the incremental improvements made by each of the $M$ trees, 
   with each tree trained to correct the residuals of the ensemble up 
   to that point.

### Key Concepts

1. **Loss Function**: The loss function measures the discrepancy 
   between the actual and predicted values. It guides the model 
   updates. Common choices include:
   
   - Squared error for regression: 
     $L(y, F(x)) = \frac{1}{2} (y - F(x))^2$.
   - Logistic loss for binary classification: 
     $L(y, F(x)) = \log(1 + \exp(-y \, F(x)))$.

2. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate scales the contribution of 
   each tree and helps control the speed of learning. A smaller 
   learning rate typically requires more trees but results in a more 
   robust model with better generalization.

3. **Regularization**: Boosted trees incorporate regularization to 
   avoid overfitting, including:
   
   - Tree depth: Limits the maximum depth of each tree, reducing 
     model complexity.
   - L1/L2 penalties: Regularize the weights of the trees, similar 
     to Lasso and Ridge regression.
   - Subsampling: Uses a fraction of the training data at each 
     iteration, making the model more robust to overfitting and 
     improving generalization.

### Why Boosting Works

The iterative approach of boosting, focusing on correcting the errors 
of the ensemble at each step, distinguishes gradient boosting from 
other ensemble methods like bagging or random forests. Key reasons 
for its effectiveness include:

1. **Error Correction**: By focusing on the hardest-to-predict 
   instances, boosting gradually improves model accuracy, leading to 
   better performance than models trained independently.
   
2. **Weighted Learning**: Boosting adjusts the weights of training 
   samples based on errors, ensuring that the model learns 
   disproportionately from difficult cases, reducing bias.

3. **Flexibility**: Boosted trees can handle various loss functions, 
   making them suitable for different types of tasks, including 
   regression, classification, and ranking.

### Applications and Popular Implementations

Boosted trees are widely used in real-world applications, ranging from 
financial risk modeling to predictive maintenance. They are also 
favored in machine learning competitions due to their interpretability 
and robustness. Popular implementations include:

- XGBoost: Known for its speed and performance, with features like 
  regularization, column sampling, and advanced tree pruning.
- LightGBM: Optimized for speed and scalability, using histogram-
  based algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently.
- CatBoost: Effective with categorical features, using advanced 
  encoding techniques and built-in support for categorical variables.
