### Setting up the Project Structure

As mentioned in the previous section,
a Python package is a collection of Python modules organized 
within a directory structure, making code reusable and distributable. 

To start packaging your project, 
you need to create a well-organized directory structure:

```plaintext
project_NAME/
├── LICENSE
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src/
│ └── package_NAME/
│ ├── __init__.py
│ └── module_NAME.py
└── tests/
```

- `project_NAME`: Root directory.
- `pyproject.toml`: 
Configuration file containing metadata and build instructions for the package.
- `README.md`: A markdown file describing your project.
- `src`: Directory to contain your package code, separate from other files.
- `package_NAME`: Directory containing all your modules.
- `__init__.py`: Indicates that this directory should be treated as a package.

### Configuration File: `pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` file defines your package's metadata and dependencies.
Below is a sample configuration:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "pkg_peiwen"
version = "0.1.4"
authors = [
{ name="Peiwen", email="pwshyu@gmail.com" },
]
description = "This is the description string in the pyproject.toml file"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
classifiers = [
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
"Operating System :: OS Independent",
]

[project.urls]
"Homepage" = "https://github.com/peiwen-shyu/pkg"
```

This file contains:

- Package name, version, and description.
- Author details.
- Python version requirement.
- Classifiers for PyPI (e.g., compatible Python versions, license).
- URLs for homepage, documentation, etc.

### Testing Locally

Before uploading your package, you should test it locally. 
Use the following steps:

1. Install your package in a virtual environment using:
```bash
pip install -e directory_where_toml_is_located
```
The `-e` flag stands for "editable", allowing 
instant reflection of source code changes in the installed package.

2. Test your package by importing and running its functions:
```python
import pkg_peiwen

# Code to test your package functionality
print(pkg_peiwen.__version__)
print(pkg_peiwen.__doc__)
```

3. Inspect package contents:
```python
import pkgutil
import inspect

for module_info in pkgutil.iter_modules(pkg_peiwen.__path__):
module_name = f"{pkg_peiwen.__name__}.{module_info.name}"
module = __import__(module_name, fromlist=[''])
print(f"Contents of {module_name}:")
members = inspect.getmembers(module)
for name, obj in members:
if not name.startswith('_'):
print(f" - {name}: {obj.__doc__}")
```

### Building and Uploading

#### Build
Install the `build` utility for creating distribution archives:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

Run the following command 
in the root project directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located):
```bash
python3 -m build
```
This will generate distribution files in the `dist` directory.

#### Upload
Install `twine` for uploading packages to PyPI:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

Upload your package to PyPI:
```bash
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

You will need your PyPI token, 
which can be generated from your PyPI account settings.

### Versioning and Updates

When updating your package, remember to:
1. Update the `version` field in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`.
2. Remove the `dist` directory for a clean build:
```bash
rm -rf dist/*
```
3. Rebuild and re-upload your package.

### Conclusion

Packaging your Python project not only makes your code portable 
and reusable but also ensures version control and eases dependency management.
Following the above steps, 
you can create, test, and upload your Python package to PyPI.
