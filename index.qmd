insights into the evolution of the course content and the
different perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.


## Compiling the Classnotes
To reproduce the classnotes output on your own computer, here are the
necessary steps:

+ Clone the classnotes repository to an appropriate location on your
  computer; see Chapter @sec-git for using Git.
+ Set up a Python virtual environment in the root folder of the
  source; see Section @sec-python-venv.
+ Activate your virtual environment.
+ Install all the packages specified in `requirements.txt` in your
  virtual environment:
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
+ For some chapters that need to interact with Google map services,
  you need to save your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in the
  root folder of the source.
+ Render the book with `quarto render` from the root folder on a
  terminal; the rendered book will be stored under `_book`.


## Midterm Project

Reproduce NYC street flood research [@agonafir2022machine;
@agonafir2022understanding].


Four students will be selected to present their work in a workshop at
the [2025 NYC Open Data Week](https://2025.open-data.nyc). You are
welcome to invite your family and friends to join the the workshop.


## Final Project

Students are encouraged to start designing their final projects from
the beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be
used. Here is a list of data challenges that you may find useful:

+ [ASA Data Challenge
  Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home): big data in 2025
+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)
+ [15 Data Science Hackathons to Test Your Skills in 2025](https://www.fynd.academy/blog/data-science-hackathons}

If you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a
poster to [Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium
(CSAS) 2025](https://statds.org/events/csas2025/).


## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition

In this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a
critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this
insightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:

> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,
> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of
> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown
> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online
> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a
> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found
> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is
> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible
> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you
> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.

This quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our
students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast
resources available to solve complex problems in data science.
Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware);
search and find solutions to encountered problems.

## Course Logistics
### Presentation Orders

The topic presentation order is set up in class.
```{python}
#| eval: true

with open('rosters/3255.txt', 'r') as file:
    ug = [line.strip() for line in file]
with open('rosters/5255.txt', 'r') as file:
    gr = [line.strip() for line in file]
presenters = ug + gr
target = "Blanchard"  # pre-arranged 1st presenter
presenters = [name for name in presenters if target not in name]

import random
## seed jointly set by the class
random.seed(5347 + 2896 + 9050 + 1687 + 63)
random.sample(presenters, len(presenters))
## random.shuffle(presenters) # This would shuffle the list in place
```

Switching slots is allowed as long as you find someone who
is willing to switch with you. In this case, make a pull request
to switch the order and let me know.


You are welcome to choose a topic that you are interested the 
most, subject to some order restrictions. For example, decision
tree should be presented before random forest or extreme gradient
boosting. This justifies certain requests for switching slots.

final presentation. An [introduction on how to use Quarto to prepare
presentation slides](https://github.com/statds/ids-f24/blob/main/templates/presentation.qmd)
is availabe under the `templates` directory in
the classnotes source tree, thank to Zachary Blanchard, which can
be used as a template to start with.

   Date  | Presenter
  ------ | ---------------------- 
   11/18 | Sara Clokey; Dorothea Johnson; Xavier Febles; Jack Bienvenue
   11/20 | Julia Mazzola; Suha Akach; Rahul Manna; Jaden Astle

### Contributing to the Class Notes

Contribution to the class notes is through a `pull request'.

+ Start a new branch and switch to the new branch.
+ On the new branch, add a `qmd` file for your presentation
+ If using Python, create and activate a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` 
+ Edit `_quarto.yml` add a line for your `qmd` file to include it in the notes.
+ Work on your qmd file, test with `quarto render`.
+ When satisfied, commit and make a pull request with your quarto files and an updated `requirements.txt`.

I have added a template file `mysection.qmd` and a new line to `_quarto.yml`
as an example.

For more detailed style guidance, please see my notes on [statistical
writing](https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/using-the-right-tools-for-writing.html#latex-for-typesetting).


Plagiarism is to be prevented. Remember that these class notes are publicly
available online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on [how to
avoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). 
In particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use
our own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the
code chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.


### Homework Logistics


#### Workflow of Submitting Homework Assisngment

+ Click the GitHub classroom assignment link in HuskCT announcement.
+ Accept the assignment and follow the instructions to an empty
  repository.
+ Make a clone of the repo at an appropriate folder on your own
  computer with `git clone`.
+ Go to this folder, add your qmd source, work on it, and group your
  changes to different commits.
+ Push your work to your GitHub repo with `git push`.
+ Create a new release and put the generated pdf file in it for ease
  of grading.


#### Requirements
+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See Chapter @sec-git.
    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).
        - Never "Upload" your files; use the git command lines.
        - Make commit message informative (think about the readers).
    - Make at least 10 commits and form a style of frequent small commits.
+ Track `quarto` sources only in your repo. See Chapter @sec-quarto.
+ For the convenience of grading, add your standalone html or pdf
  output to a release in your repo.
+ For standalone pdf output, you will need to have
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed.

### Quizzes about Syllabus

+ Do I accept late homework?
+ Could you list a few examples of email etiquette?
+ How would you lose style points?
+ Would you use CLI and GUI?
+ How many students will present at 2025 NYC ODW and when will the
  presentations be?
+ What's the first date on which you have to complete something about
  your final project?
+ Can you use AI for any task in this course? 
+ Anybody needs a reference letter? How could you help me to help you?

## Practical Tips

### Data analysis

+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively
+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing
+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later
+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators

### Presentation

+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator.
+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code.
+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize.
+ Use your own examples to reduce the risk of plagiarism.
